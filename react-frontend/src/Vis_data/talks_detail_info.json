Then he takes on The Purpose-Driven Life, disputing its claim that, to be moral, one must deny evolution. Philosopher and scientist Dan Dennett argues that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes and are not what we traditionally think they are. His 2003 book Freedom Evolves explores the way our brains have evolved to give us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006's Breaking the Spell examines religious belief through the lens of biology.",

   "description": "In this provocative talk, journalist Andrew Mwenda asks us to reframe the \"African question\" -- to look beyond the media's stories of poverty, civil war and helplessness and see the opportunities for creating wealth and happiness throughout the continent. Journalist Andrew Mwenda has spent his career fighting for free speech and economic empowerment throughout Africa. He argues that aid makes objects of the poor -- they become passive recipients of charity rather than active participants in their own economic betterment.",

He talks about what such life would be like -- and how we might find it.  With Freeman Dyson's astonishing forecasts for the future, it's hard to tell where science ends and science fiction begins. But far from being a wild-eyed visionary, Dyson is a clear and sober thinker -- and one not afraid of controversy or heresy.",

She says environmentally sound mass production will feed the world, yet leave a role for small bakeries and traditional methods. A powerful thinker and globe-trotting advisor on sustainability, Louise Fresco says it's time to think of food as a topic of social and economic importance on par with oil -- that responsible agriculture and food consumption are crucial to world stability.",

   "description": "Statistician Nic Marks asks why we measure a nation's success by its productivity -- instead of by the happiness and well-being of its people. He introduces the Happy Planet Index, which tracks national well-being against resource use (because a happy life doesn't have to cost the earth). Which countries rank highest in the HPI? You might be surprised. Nic Marks gathers evidence about what makes us happy, and uses it to promote policy that puts the well-being of people and the planet first. He's the founder of the Centre for Well-Being at the UK think tank New Economics Foundation (NEF).",

His work is vital in setting baselines for fixing our current climate -- and in tracking the rise of deadly ocean acidification. Rob Dunbar looks deeply at ancient corals and sediments to study how the climate and the oceans have shifted over the past 50 to 12,000 years -- and how the Antarctic ecosystem is changing right now.",

In a series of real-life experiments from New Delhi to South Africa to Italy, he gave kids self-supervised access to the web and saw results that could revolutionize how we think about teaching. Sugata Mitra's \"Hole in the Wall\" experiments have shown that, in the absence of supervision or formal teaching, children can teach themselves and each other, if they're motivated by curiosity and peer interest.",

Marine biologist Barbara Block fits tuna with tracking tags (complete with transponders) that record unprecedented amounts of data about these gorgeous, threatened fish and the ocean habitats they move through. Barbara Block studies how tuna, billfish and sharks move around (and stay warm) in the open ocean. Knowing how these large predators travel through pelagic waters will help us understand their role in the wider ocean ecosystem.",

Deborah Rhodes is an expert at managing breast-cancer risk. The director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Executive Health Program is now testing a gamma camera that can see tumors that get missed by mammography.",

   "description": "Physicists are used to the idea that subatomic particles behave according to the bizarre rules of quantum mechanics, completely different to human-scale objects. In a breakthrough experiment, Aaron O'Connell has blurred that distinction by creating an object that is visible to the unaided eye, but provably in two places at the same time. In this talk he suggests an intriguing way of thinking about the result. Aaron O'Connell is the first person to experimentally induce and measure quantum effects in the motion of a humanmade object, bridging the quantum and classical worlds.",

So, in a new approach, he's taking living descendants of the dinosaur (chickens) and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits \u2014 including teeth, tails, and even hands \u2014 to make a \"Chickenosaurus\". Jack Horner and his dig teams have discovered the first evidence of parental care in dinosaurs, extensive nesting grounds, evidence of dinosaur herds, and the world\u2019s first dinosaur embryos. He's now exploring how to build a dinosaur.",

And he warns that we are writing code we can't understand, with implications we can't control. Kevin Slavin navigates in the algoworld, the expanding space in our lives that\u2019s determined and run by algorithms.",

   "description": "What if every light bulb in the world could also transmit data? At TEDGlobal, Harald Haas demonstrates, for the first time, a device that could do exactly that. By flickering the light from a single LED, a change too quick for the human eye to detect, he can transmit far more data than a cellular tower -- and do it in a way that's more efficient, secure and widespread. Harald Haas is the pioneer behind a new type of light bulb that can communicate as well as illuminate \u2013 access the Internet using light instead of radio waves.",

Social activist Karen Tse shows how we can, and should, stand up and end the use of routine torture. In too many countries, it's still normal to torture prisoners for confessions and information. Karen Tse works to end that.",

At the TEDxSummit in Doha, physicist Wolfgang Kessling reveals sustainable design innovations that cool us from above and below, and even collects solar energy for later use. Wolfgang Kessling and his team at Transsolar designed the solar cooling and comfort concepts that helped Qatar win the bid for the 2022 football World Cup.",

   "description": "After a natural disaster strikes, there\u2019s only a tiny window of opportunity to rally effective recovery efforts before the world turns their attention elsewhere. Who should be in charge? When a freak tornado hit their hometown, sisters Caitria and Morgan O\u2019Neill -- just 20 and 24 at the time -- took the reins and are now teaching others how to do the same. (.) When a freak tornado hit her Massachusetts hometown, Caitria O\u2019Neill wasn't an expert in disaster relief recovery. But she learned quickly and is now passing her knowledge on through the website Recovers.org.  Pursuing her PhD in atmospheric science did not prepare Morgan O'Neill for a freak tornado hitting her hometown. With her sister, she helped coordinate a local relief effort and is teaching other towns to do the same through the website Recovers.org.",

   "description": "In her New Orleans neighborhood, artist and TED Fellow Candy Chang turned an abandoned house into a giant chalkboard asking a fill-in-the-blank question: \u201cBefore I die I want to ___.\u201d Her neighbors' answers -- surprising, poignant, funny -- became an unexpected mirror for the community. (What's your answer?) Candy Chang creates art that prompts people to think about their secrets, wishes and hopes -- and then share them. She is a TED Senior Fellow.",

   "speaker": "Scott Fraser",
   "event": "TEDxUSC",
   "description": "Scott Fraser studies how humans remember crimes -- and bear witness to them. In this powerful talk, which focuses on a deadly shooting at sunset, he suggests that even close-up eyewitnesses to a crime can create \"memories\" they could not have seen. Why? Because the brain abhors a vacuum. Scott Fraser is a forensic psychologist who thinks deeply about the fallibility of human memory and encourages a more scientific approach to trial evidence.",

   "event": "TEDGlobal 2012",
   "description": "Brute computing force alone can\u2019t solve the world\u2019s problems. Data mining innovator Shyam Sankar explains why solving big problems (like catching terrorists or identifying huge hidden trends) is not a question of finding the right algorithm, but rather the right symbiotic relationship between computation and human creativity. An advocate of human-computer symbiosis, Shyam Sankar looks for clues in big and disparate data sets.",
